    Stopping your delegation is subject to a cooldown period, in which the stake cannot be spent or transferred.
</p>
<p>
    While in the cooldown period your delegation continues to earn rewards.
</p>
<p>
    At the end of the cooldown period, the delegated amount is unlocked on your public balance, and
    the funds will be at disposal again.
