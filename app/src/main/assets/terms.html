<h1>Terms and conditions for CryptoX Wallet</h1>
<p class="eff">Effective from May 15th 2021</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>CryptoX Wallet is a digital wallet that is offered worldwide by Pioneering Technology Ventures ApS. At
  pioneeringtechventures.com, you can read about how the app works. Pioneering Technology Ventures ApS may continually
  change and/or adjust the functions of CryptoX Wallet. Pioneering Technology Ventures ApS’s terms and conditions apply
  to CryptoX Wallet users worldwide.</p>
<p>The wallet will register and use data about you. Pioneering Technology Ventures ApS will not register or use data
  about you.</p>
<h2>Terms and conditions for all services and functions</h2>
<h2>Parties to the agreement</h2>
<p>When you register with CryptoX Wallet, you enter into an agreement with:</p>
<p>Pioneering Technology Ventures ApS, Skrænten 8, 8900 Randers C, Denmark. Reg no.: DK-427.536.88. Our email address is
  contact@pioneeringtechventures.com.</p>
<h2>What do you need in order to register with CryptoX Wallet</h2>
<p>The following is required to register with CryptoX Wallet:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Have a mobile device (e.g., smartphone or tablet). You can see which operating systems can be used at
    pioneeringtechventures.com.</li>
  <li>Verify your identity with an identity provider. The identity provider will know the identity of the initial
    account creator.</li>
</ul>
<p>You must be at least 18 years old to register.</p>

<h2>Registering as a CryptoX Wallet user</h2>
<p>Before you can use CryptoX Wallet, you will need to create an initial account and register with an identity provider
  by following the instructions in the app. An identity provider is a third-party supplier and independent of Pioneering
  Technology Ventures ApS. The CryptoX Wallet stores data from the identity provider, but Pioneering Technology Ventures
  ApS does not.</p>
<p>After you have created the initial account and registered with an identity provider, you can create additional
  accounts (‘regular accounts’) with which you will be able to carry out transactions.</p>
<p>Please note that you can only register one account as the initial account.</p>

<h2>Activation code and personal password</h2>
<p>When you register in CryptoX Wallet, you will need to create a personal passcode. If your mobile device supports it,
  you can subsequently activate your fingerprint or use facial recognition instead of the 6-digit password. You should
  be aware that all fingerprints/facial recognitions linked to your mobile device can be used to log on to CryptoX
  Wallet and use the functions. You are therefore obliged to ensure that you have only activated your own fingerprints
  and your own facial recognition if you want to use them instead of the 6-digit password for access to CryptoX Wallet.
  CryptoX Wallet does not store your fingerprints or facial recognition.</p>

<h2>Other obligations etc.</h2>
<p>You have a duty to ensure that the details you provide are correct and updated at any given time. Your CryptoX Wallet
  account is personal and may be used only by you. You must not disclose your passwords to others, write them down, or
  save them on your mobile device.</p>
<p>CryptoX Wallet must not be used for illegal activities or purposes.</p>
<p>You must not use CryptoX Wallet in a way that harasses other CryptoX Wallet users.</p>
<p>All transaction requests are irreversible. You are yourself responsible for ensuring that the recipient of a
  transaction via CryptoX Wallet is the intended recipient, and you must verify that the transaction amount is correct.
  You are responsible for providing the correct account to persons and users who want to transfer funds to you.</p>
<p>To prevent unauthorized use of CryptoX Wallet, you must store your mobile device so that others cannot gain
  unauthorized access to it. If possible, you should lock your device with a password or keypad lock. Do not disclose
  the password to third parties.</p>
<p>You are obliged to verify your identity with an identity provider. The identity provider will know the identity of
  the initial account creator. Your identity can be revealed via the process of anonymity revocation, which can happen
  under stringent regulations, such as a court order.</p>
<p>You are solely responsible for safekeeping your passwords, PINs, account keys, encryption keys, identity, and any
  other codes you use to access the CryptoX Wallet or any information, CCD, or voucher. If you lose access to the Mobile
  Wallet, private keys, or identity, and you have not separately stored a backup of your accounts and the corresponding
  password(s), you acknowledge and agree that any GTU you have associated with that account will become inaccessible.
</p>
<p>Please note: If you have chosen to use assistants based on speech recognition (e.g., Siri) or patterns of use, this
  means that information about your use of CryptoX Wallet, including recipients, amounts, and messages, is sent to the
  provider of the assistant. Your own use of any assistant determines what information is sent. CryptoX Wallet does not
  send any information.</p>

<h2>Term</h2>
<p>This agreement will apply between you and Pioneering Technology Ventures ApS from your download of the CryptoX
  Wallet, and until you have completely removed the CryptoX Wallet in its entirety from your device.</p>
<p>The section <i>Pioneering Technology Ventures ApS’s liability for damages</i> shall apply indefinitely.</p>

<h2>Fees and charges</h2>
<p>Pioneering Technology Ventures ApS currently does not charge any fee for registration with CryptoX Wallet. CryptoX
  Wallet does not charge a transaction fee; however, you have to pay a transaction fee for transactions on the
  blockchain.</p>
<p>Any other costs and charges related to your use of the CryptoX Wallet shall be paid by you, including but not limited
  to costs to the identity provider, if any.</p>
<p>If we introduce new functions, features, products, or services, these may be subject to fees from the start without
  you receiving any notice of changed terms and conditions. You will always be informed about the fee before you
  register for the function, feature, product, or service.</p>

  conditions without notice. You can read the terms and conditions at pioneeringtechventures.com, from which you can

  conditions enter into force. If you notify us that you do not wish to be covered by the new terms and conditions, we
  will consider the CryptoX Wallet agreement to be terminated from the date on which the new terms and conditions enter
  into force. If we do not hear from you, we will regard it as your acceptance of the changes.</p>
