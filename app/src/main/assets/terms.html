    <strong>“our”</strong>) governing your download, installation, and use of the CryptoX Wallet in the form of

    third-party tools, applications, and protocols, together <strong>“Third Party Services”</strong>).
    You agree that by downloading, installing, and using the App, you expressly acknowledge that you have read
    and agree to be bound by these Terms and any important notices posted from time to time on [●], which is
    hereby incorporated herein by reference. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS, THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY

      components contributed by a wide variety of participants. You acknowledge that all access to and use of
      blockchains is at the sole risk of the person accessing or using such blockchains. Blockchains are

      <p>10.3.1. Using, buying, holding, and selling digital assets involve certain risks of financial loss.
        Any digital asset may be subject to fluctuations in value, including a total loss of value. The

        in significant loss over a short period of time. The nature of digital assets may lead to an
        increased risk of fraud or cyber-attack. You acknowledge these risks and agree that we cannot be
        held liable for such fluctuations or loss of value.</p>
      <p>10.3.2. Digital assets and their underlying blockchain networks are complex emerging technologies
        that are typically globally distributed across multiple, unaffiliated nodes. They may experience
        delays, halts or go offline as a result of errors, forks, attacks, or other unforeseeable reasons.
        They are also subject to speculative interest and regulatory attention, which may contribute to
        price volatility and liquidity constraints. The compatibility of a digital asset or with Third Party
        Services on the App does not indicate our approval or disapproval of the digital asset or its
        underlying technology and should not be treated as a substitute for your own understanding of the
        risks specific to each digital asset. We provide no warranty as to the suitability of any digital
        assets or Third-Party Services and assume no fiduciary duty to you in connection with your use of
        the App.</p>
      <p>10.3.3. All digital asset transactions are irreversible. You accept all consequences of using or
        transacting digital assets. Once you send digital assets to an address, you accept the risk that you
        may permanently lose access to it. You assume all liability for any losses incurred as a result of
        your transactions or transfers of digital assets. You are solely liable for verifying the accuracy
        of any external wallet address and the identity of the recipient. We do not control any blockchain
        network and cannot guarantee that any transfer will be confirmed or transferred successfully by the
        network. We are not responsible for any losses or for taking any actions to attempt to recover any
        lost, stolen, misdirected or irrecoverable digital assets.</p>

      <p>10.4.1. The technology underlying digital assets, including without limitation applied cryptography,
        blockchain, networking and distributed systems, and smart contracts, is subject to change at any
        time. Such changes may affect the App. You assume full responsibility for monitoring such
        technological changes and understanding their impact on your digital assets.</p>
      <p>10.4.2. The digital assets and their underlying networks are under development and continue to
        evolve. As such, they may be subject to material and sudden changes that may have a significant
        impact on the availability, usability, or value of a particular digital asset. In addition, as a
        general matter, the operations, functionalities, development and distributions of digital assets and
        their underlying networks are beyond our control. You agree not to hold us liable for any related
        losses.</p>
      <p>10.4.3. Blockchain networks are susceptible to various attacks such as an attack in which an attacker
        gains control of a requisite mining or validating power on the network. We cannot prevent or
        mitigate attacks on blockchain networks and has no obligation to engage in activity in relation to
        such attacks.</p>
      <p>10.4.4. We cannot guarantee the App will be available at all times. The App may include coding errors

    <p>11.1. To collect information about the usage of the App, while preserving as much user privacy as
      possible, we use cookie-less tracking in the App. We use this information to administer the App and we
      analyse this information to improve and enhance the App by expanding its features and functionality and
      tailoring it to our users’ needs and preferences. This includes tracking of App versions.</p>
    <p>11.2. When you create a Concordium Digital Identity Certificate (<strong>“Identity Certificate”</strong>)
      with a Third-Party Service, you will enter an agreement directly with such Third-Party Service and such
      Third-Party Service will store data about you. In this case, the Third-Party Service’s privacy policy
      and terms of use apply. The Third-Party Service may store a copy of the Identity Certificate for
      subsequent re-issuance; however, the Third-Party Service will not have access to your blockchain account
      address. The App stores the Identity Certificate in encrypted form, and it is not visible to us. You may
      choose to reveal and make publicly available any attributes associated with your account. However, if
      you reveal such attributes, these attributes will be visible on the blockchain, and can never be
      deleted.</p>
    <p>11.3. When you use Remote Procedure Call (“RPC”) provider in the App to interact with a blockchain,
      certain information about you is collected. Depending on the RPC provider you use, your IP address and
      your blockchain account address when you send a transaction may be collected and your account address
      will be broadcasted to the Concordium blockchain.</p>
