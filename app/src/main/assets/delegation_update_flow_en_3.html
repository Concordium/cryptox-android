<p>
    If you decrease or remove your stake, you will continue to earn rewards on it until the next pay day.
    However, the stake will not immediately be at disposal. Instead, it is subject to a cooldown
    period during which it cannot be spent or transferred, and no longer earns rewards.
    Once the cooldown period elapses, the removed stake can be spent.
</p>

<p>
    While you have stake in cooldown, you can still make changes your delegation or validator settings.
    Increasing your stake will take preferentially from the stake in cooldown, rather than your
    balance at disposal.
