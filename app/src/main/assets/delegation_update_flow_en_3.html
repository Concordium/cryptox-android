    Reducing your stake is subject to a cool-down period, in which the stake cannot be spent or transferred.
</p>

<p>
    Your delegation continues earning rewards during the cool-down period. While in the cooldown
    period you can update other delegation settings.
</p>

<p>
    If you made any other changes to your delegation while also decreasing your delegation amount,
    the other changes will take effect from the next pay day as described on the previous page.
