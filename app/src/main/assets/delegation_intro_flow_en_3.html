    A validator pool is managed by an individual validator.
</p>
<p>
    Running a pool allows a validator to attract more stake and thus increase chances of being selected
    to validate a block.
</p>
<p>
    Validators also earn a commission from the delegators upon validating a block.
</p>
<p>
    Delegating to a validator pool is usually more profitable than passive delegation, but there is also
    a risk of losing out on rewards if the validator is not running properly. It is therefore a good
    idea to keep an eye on the validator’s performance.
